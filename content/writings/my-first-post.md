# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post on my new blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development, design, and technology.

## What I'm Building

I've built this blog using modern technologies:

- **Next.js 15** - The React framework for production
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience

## Features

This blog includes several great features:

1. **Clean Design** - Minimal, typography-focused design without shadows
2. **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes
3. **Global Search** - Search across all content types
4. **Responsive** - Works great on all devices
5. **Fast** - Static generation for optimal performance

## What's Next

I plan to write about:

- Web development best practices
- Design systems and component libraries
- Open source projects
- Weekly reflections in my weeknotes

Stay tuned for more content!
