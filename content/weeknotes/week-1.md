# Week 1, 2024

Welcome to my first weeknote of 2024! I'm starting a new tradition of weekly reflections.

## What I Did

This week I focused on building this new blog:

- Set up the project structure with Next.js 15
- Integrated shadcn/ui for beautiful components
- Implemented global search functionality
- Created a clean, minimal design
- Added dark mode support

## What I Learned

Building with the new Next.js app router has been a great experience. The file-based routing makes organizing content intuitive, and the built-in TypeScript support saves a lot of time.

## Challenges

The main challenge was getting MDX processing to work smoothly with the app router. After some research, I found that `next-mdx-remote` provides the flexibility I needed.

## Next Week

Goals for next week:

- Write more blog posts
- Add projects showcase
- Optimize search performance
- Consider adding RSS feed

## Reading

I've been reading "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. The concept of 1% daily improvements really resonates with my approach to learning new technologies.

- [Next.js App Router Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
- [shadcn/ui Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)

That's a wrap for week 1! Looking forward to sharing more next week.
